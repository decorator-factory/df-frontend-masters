## About fonts

It is [probably better to host all the fonts yourself](https://wicki.io/posts/2020-11-goodbye-google-fonts/) instead of using an external CDN. However, I'll be adding a lot of challenges here and I don't want to bloat the size of the Git repository with 50 fonts, so I'm going to use Google Fonts.

Alas I can't outsource the images to a different place, so they're going to stay.
