## Modifications

I added some fancy tweaks so that the card is more space-efficient when it's small:

- padding around the image is now gone, this way you can see more detail on the image when it's tiny, instead of wasting the space on the padding;
- the "Learning" tag sinks into the image slightly to reduce vertical space;
- the vertical spacing gets a bit smaller.

This is frankly a bit overengineered.
